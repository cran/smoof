smoof v1.3 (Release data: 2016-02-23)
============

* Modified: function name is optional now
* Added optional reference point ref.point for multi-objective functions
  - Reference point for ZDT functions is (11, 11)
  - Reference point for DTLZ function family is r = (11, ...,  11) with #r = #objectives
  - Added getter getRefPoint
* Added possibility to pass the true mean function of a noisy function, i.e., the
  "unnoisy" via the smoof parameter fn.mean
  - Added getter getMeanFunction
* makeMPM2Function now has additional parameters rotated and peak.shape

smoof v1.2 (Release data: 2016-01-21)
============

* Added: functions convertToMaximization and convertToMinimization
* Added: main parameter for plot and autoplot. By default the function name is
  used for the plot title.
* Fixed: autoplot and plot do not work for wrapped functions.
* objective functions now can be passed an additional id attribute. All predefined
  smoof functions have an id now.
* visualizeParetoOptimalFront now works for bi-objective functions with arbitrary
  search space dimensions and works by calling the mco::nsga2 algorithm. Due to
  this, the parameters show.only.front, limits.by.front are dropped.
* Renamed makeFunctionByName to makeFunctionsByName
* Added tags 'single-objective' and 'multi-objective'
* filterFunctionByTags now stops if both 'single-objective' and 'multi-objective'
  tags are passed
* All functions now check the passed paramter to be of the right dimension and
  type
* makeFunctionsByName now expects a character vector generator names (the list
  methods was removed)
* Generator names now do not contain the 'Function' suffix
* Fixed: hasConstraints for wrapped smoof functions
* Fixed: getUpperBoxConstraints

smoof v1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-24):
============

* Parameter set of predefined smoof function now contains a single vector parameter
  instead of multiple single numeric parameters. This is consistent with function
  calls now, since these always expect a single vector or list.
* Added helper function get{Lower,Upper}BoxConstraints
* smoof functions now expect an optional 'minimize' argument which indicates which
  objectives should be minimized or maximized respectively
* Fixed some wrong tag assigments
* Added shouldBeMinimized function
* Fixed global optimum of Giunta function
* Added function makeFunctionByName, which expects a function name or a list of
  functions names. The corresponding generator(s) is/are  called. Useful if you want,
  e.g., filter functions by tags and generate them directly afterwards.
* Added hasTags helper function.
* filterFunctionByTags now has an additional logical argument 'or'. If this is set
  to TRUE, a subset of the passed tags is sufficient to select a function.
* Added multi-objective DTLZ function family
* Added 2D single objective functions: Aluffi-Pentini-(Zirilli), Complex, Engvall,
  Jennrich-Sampsam, Judge, Kearfott
* Renamed bochachevsky function to bohachevsky.n1

smoof v1.0 (Release date: 2015-05-19):
==========

* First submission to CRAN.
