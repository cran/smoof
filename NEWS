smoof v1.0.9 (Release date: ...):
============

* Parameter set of predefined smoof function now contains a single vector parameter
  instead of multiple single numeric parameters. This is consistent with function
  calls now, since these always expect a single vector or list.
* Added helper function get{Lower,Upper}BoxConstraints
* smoof functions now expect an optional 'minimize' argument which indicates which
  objectives should be minimized or maximized respectively
* Fixed some wrong tag assigments
* Added shouldBeMinimized function
* Fixed global optimum of Giunta function
* Added function makeFunctionByName, which expects a function name or a list of
  functions names. The corresponding generator(s) is/are  called. Useful if you want,
  e.g., filter functions by tags and generate them directly afterwards.
* Added hasTags helper function.
* filterFunctionByTags now has an additional logical argument 'or'. If this is set
  to TRUE, a subset of the passed tags is sufficient to select a function.
* Added multi-objective DTLZ function family
* Added 2D single objective functions: Aluffi-Pentini-(Zirilli), Complex, Engvall,
  Jennrich-Sampsam, Judge, Kearfott
* Renamed bochachevsky function to bohachevsky.n1
